# 100% Original Songs

*Instructor Adrien Dion started the tradition of writing and performing parodies of popular songs during graduation every month at Coding Dojo. These songs parodied the life of a developer and the challenges of learning how to code. You can find a [repo of all his songs here](https://github.com/adion81/GraduationSongs).*

*After Adrien moved on from the Dojo, I wanted to keep the tradition alive. Sometimes I write the lyrics, and sometimes a staff member or student writes the new lyrics to the "100% original songs".*
