# Algos in O(n)

#### Lyrics by Narciso Lobo

*A parody of Fire and Rain, by James Taylor*

### Verse 1

**[C]** Seems like yesterday **[Gm]** mornin’  
You wrote your **[F]** first line of **[C]** code  
**[C]** Wrestling with **[G]** CSS seemed like a **[Bbmaj7]** losing game  
**[C]** Now fourteen weeks **[Gm]** later  
You’re writing **[F]** servers in **[C]** Node  
**[C]** Ain’t no **[G]** framework or tech stack that **[Bbmaj7]** you can’t tame

### Chorus

**[F]** **[F/E]** I’ve seen **[F/D]** algos in **[F/G]** O of **[C]** (n)  
I’ve seen **[F]** SQL **[F/E]** queries I **[F/D]** thought would **[F/G]** never **[C]** end  
But like a **[F]** for loop **[F/E]** just be- **[F/D]** fore it **[F/G]** incre- **[C]** ments  
Every **[Bb]** ending’s **[F/A]** just a **[Gm]** new beginning **[C11]**  

### Verse 2

When you **[C]** look back on your **[Gm]** teachers  
And the **[F]** friends that you’ve **[C]** made  
**[C]** I hope that you **[G]** smile inside when you **[Bbmaj7]** think of us  
**[C]** So many “s”s for- **[Gm]** gotten  
So much **[F]** ping pong was **[C]** played  
**[C]** You’d think Forrest **[G]** Gump’s in charge of cur- **[Bbmaj7]** riculum

### Chorus

**[F]** **[F/E]** I’ve seen **[F/D]** algos in **[F/G]** O of **[C]** (n)  
I’ve seen **[F]** SQL **[F/E]** queries I **[F/D]** thought would **[F/G]** never **[C]** end  
But like a **[F]** for loop **[F/E]** just be- **[F/D]** fore it **[F/G]** incre- **[C]** ments  
Every **[Bb]** ending’s **[F/A]** just a **[Gm]** new beginning **[C11]**  

### Verse 3

When you're **[C]** knocking on doors
Babe, you **[Gm]** better know
The **[F]** Dojo’s got your **[C]** back
**[C]** Cater- **[G]** pillars turning into **[Bbmaj7]** butterflies
**[C]** Sure, sensei **[Gm]** Seeso didn’t get to **[F]** teach you a **[C]** stack
**[C]** But it’s sure been a **[G]** joy watching y’all meta- **[Bbmaj7]** morphosize

### Chorus

**[F]** **[F/E]** I’ve seen **[F/D]** algos in **[F/G]** O of **[C]** (n)  
I’ve seen **[F]** SQL **[F/E]** queries I **[F/D]** thought would **[F/G]** never **[C]** end  
But like a **[F]** for loop **[F/E]** just be- **[F/D]** fore it **[F/G]** incre- **[C]** ments  
Every **[Bb]** ending’s **[F/A]** just a **[Gm]** new beginning **[C11]**
