# The Coder

## Verse Chords -

**| F | Bb | C | Bb |**  
Some people call me the web ninja  
Some call me the master of CRUD  
Some people call me Monsanto  
'Cause I stomp on all those pesky little bugs  
  
Been staring at my code for hours, baby  
Terminal says I'm doin' it wrong, doin' it wrong  
Can't see that missing 's' on line 23  
Think I need someone to come proofread for me  
  
## Chorus Chords -

**| F | Bb | F | Bb |**  
**| F | Bb | C | Bb |**  
'Cause I'm a hacker  
A firecracker  
I’m a three full stacker  
The Dojo's been a wild ride  
I'm a coder  
Data loader  
I’m an algo Yoda  
Can't say how many times I've cried  
I'm a ninja  
Server spinner  
Didn’t think I could do it did ya?  
The Dojo's been a wild ride  
I'm a coder  
Data loader  
I’m an algo Yoda  
I got my duckie on the side  
  
You got the greatest repo that I ever did see  
I really love your ReadMe  
Wanna collab please?  
Git pushing, git pulling, git branching all the time  
Got my project, baby, I'll sure finish it on time  
  
[Chorus]
  
Been staring at my code for hours, baby  
Terminal says I'm doin' it wrong  
But I don't worry, don't worry, no don't worry mama  
'Cause I know that error code  
You got the greatest repo that I ever did see  
I really love your ReadMe  
Wanna collab please?  
Git pushing, git pulling, git branching all the time  
Got my project and I'll sure finish it on time
