# Function Calls

#### Lyrics by Narciso Lobo

*A parody of Waterfalls, by TLC*

### Verse 1

**[D]** Lonely button gazing **[A]** out from a window  
Staring **[C]** at a dev that she just can’t **[G]** thrill  
**[D]** She’d like to dazzle, she’d **[A]** like to shine, but ends up lookin’  
**[C]** Like a pebble tossed in some **[G]** milk

**[D]** But all the pleading just ain’t **[A]** helping at all  
‘Cause he can’t **[C]** seem to learn no Bootstrap or nothing  
So, he codes his **[D]** inputs and his fields with no a- **[A]** lignment in sight  
Another **[C]** boring gray rectangular **[G]** button  
Listen to me  
  
### Chorus

**[D]** Don't go placing **[A]** function calls  
Please stick to the **[C]** pixels and the points that you're **[G]** used to  
I know that you're **[D]** gonna have your back end or **[A]** nothing at all  
But don’t forget about **[C]** CSS **[G]**  
  
### Verse 2

**[D]** Little precious has a **[A]** web application  
With some **[C]** session and full C. R. U. **[G]** D.  
**[D]** All the fonts are still de- **[A]** fault Times New Roman  
But all **[C]** he can say, “It is what it **[G]** needs to be.”  
  
**[D]** One day he tries to make a **[A]** dope portfolio  
But he **[C]** can’t display one inline **[G]** block  
**[D]** His jobs are fadin’ and he **[A]** doesn’t know why  
Three letters **[C]** took him back to punching a **[G]** time clock  
Y'all don't hear me  
  
**[D]** Little precious has a **[A]** web application  
With some **[C]** session and full C. R. U. **[G]** D.  
**[D]** All the fonts are still de- **[A]** fault Times New Roman  
But all **[C]** he can say, “It is what it **[G]** needs to be.”

### Chorus

**[D]** Don't go placing **[A]** function calls  
Please stick to the **[C]** pixels and the points that you're **[G]** used to  
I know that you're **[D]** gonna have your back end or **[A]** nothing at all  
But don’t forget about **[C]** CSS **[G]**
