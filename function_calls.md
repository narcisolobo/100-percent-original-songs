# Function Calls

## Chord Progression: | D | A | C | G |

Lonely button gazing out from a window  
Staring at a dev that she just can’t thrill  
She’d like to dazzle, she’d like to shine, but ends up lookin’  
Like a pebble tossed in some milk  
  
But all the pleading just ain’t helping at all  
‘Cause he can’t seem to learn no Bootstrap or nothing  
So, he codes his inputs and his fields with no alignment in sight  
Another boring gray rectangular button  
Listen to me  
  
Don't go placing function calls  
Please stick to the pixels and the points that you're used to  
I know that you're gonna have your back end or nothing at all  
But don’t forget about CSS  
  
Little precious has a web application  
With some session and full C. R. U. D.  
All the fonts are still default Times New Roman  
But all he can say, “It is what it needs to be.”  
  
One day he tries to make a dope portfolio  
But he can’t display one inline-block  
His jobs are fadin’ and he doesn’t know why  
Three letters took him back to punching a time clock  
Y'all don't hear me  
  
Don't go placing function calls  
Please stick to the pixels and the points that you're used to  
I know that you're gonna have your back end or nothing at all  
But don’t forget about CSS
