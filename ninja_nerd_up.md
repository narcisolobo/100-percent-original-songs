# (Ninja) Nerd Up

#### Lyrics by Narciso Lobo

*A parody of Word Up, by Cameo*

**Chords:**  
**| F#m - - - | E - - - | D - E - | F#m - - - |**  

### Verse 1

Y’all funky ninjas in this Dojo  
Your success in this here bootcamp gives us so much mojo  
Your instructors, your cohort, and your TA’s too  
Everybody’s so proud that we don’t know what to do  

We are overjoyed ‘cause you deployed  
We’re smiling all the time, I think our families are annoyed  
All you grads, all you grads  
Do your grad thing, mama  
Come on baby, we the ninja nerds!  

### Chorus

So nerd up!  
We’re all in luck  
We’re never all alone we have our trusty rubber duck  
  
Nerd up!  
We’re the code nerds  
We funkify our functions and bcrypt our passwords

### Verse 2

Now all you big tech firms, and startups too  
We gonna moonwalk in your office with our silicon shoes  
The elevator’s pitched, ready to schmooze  
Just wait until you hear our algorithm and blues

Our linked ins need no fixings, we on the ball  
If you need some funky ninjas baby, you know who to call  
You can call, you can call  
You can call me, mama  
Yeah you know you need a ninja nerd!

### Chorus

Nerd up!  
We’re all in luck  
We’re never all alone we have our trusty rubber duck

Nerd up!  
We’re the code nerds  
We funkify our functions and bcrypt our passwords
